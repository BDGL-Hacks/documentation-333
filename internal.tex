\section{Overview}

PartyUp is an iOS app written in Swift.
The app's back end is hosted on an Amazon Web Services
EC2 instance running Ubuntu.
The back end is built using the Django web framework and uses
a MySQL database.
PartyUp uses Git for version control and the code for the project is 
hosted on \href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}.
The iOS code and back end code can be found at 
\url{https://github.com/BDGL-Hacks/iOS-333} and
\url{https://github.com/BDGL-Hacks/backend-333} respectively.

I Dont know how much detail we need to go into about how
Django works. Like, do we need to talk about urls.py, settings.py,
models.py, views.py, and etc.?
