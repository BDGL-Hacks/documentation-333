        When you are going out for a night with friends you want to have fun.
        However, in order to have fun you would like to be sure that you can stay in touch
        with the friends in your group and also that your friends make it home safely.
        PartyUp is a new iOS app that helps you stay in touch with the people that matter.
        PartyUp lets you create an itinerary for your group so that everyone in the group
        knows where to go.
        During your night out, PartyUp keeps track of where you and your group members
        are in the itinerary so you can easily find someone if you lose track of them.
        PartyUp also promotes party safety with a "ping" feature that allows users to
        check whether their group members are okay with a single tap.
        <br>
        PartyUp is your hub for simple group communication and fluid event planning.

        How to access or create a running version of your system.
        If your system is web-based, this should be a URL.
        If your system is a phone application,
        this should reference an installable version.
        Don't forget to provide passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them
        to experiment with your system.
        <i> Please make this as easy for us as possible.</i>  There are 45 projects and if
        we have to blow 15 minutes figuring out how to run your system, that's one very
        long day wasted.

    <p> These links must point to PDF files <b>with exactly the
    specified names</b>.  They must not require logging into some place
    like Google Docs or GitHub.  We need to have all submissions in
    one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
    access the pieces easily.

    Thanks.
