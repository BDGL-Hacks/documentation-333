    <p>The elevator speech description goes here.</p>
    <p>
    How to access or create a running version of your system.
    If your system is web-based, this should be a URL.
    If your system is a phone application,
    this should reference an installable version.
    Don't forget to provide passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them
    to experiment with your system.
    <i> Please make this as easy for us as possible.</i>  There are 45 projects and if
    we have to blow 15 minutes figuring out how to run your system, that's one very
    long day wasted.
    </p>
    <p>If something goes wrong, please contact Blake Lawson at blawson@princeton.edu.</p>

    <p> These links must point to PDF files <b>with exactly the
    specified names</b>.  They must not require logging into some place
    like Google Docs or GitHub.  We need to have all submissions in
    one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
    access the pieces easily.

    Thanks.
